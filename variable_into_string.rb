# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# first_name = "Cale"
# last_name = "Anderson"
# p first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first_name = "Cale"
# last_name = "Anderson"
# p "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# print "Please input a word:"
# input = gets.chomp.downcase
# if input == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# color1 = "yellow"
# color2 = "orange"
# color3 = "blue"

# p "My favorite colors are " + color1 + ", " + color2 + ", and " + color3 + "."

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# color1 = "yellow"
# color2 = "orange"
# color3 = "blue"

# p "My favorite colors are #{color1}, #{color2}, and #{color3}"

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# print "Please enter a name:"
# input = gets.chomp.downcase
# if input != "santa"
#   p "You're not Santa."
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# book_title = "Hatchet"
# book_author = "Gary Paulsen"

# p "My favorite book is " + book_title + " by " + book_author + "."

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# book_title = "Hatchet"
# book_author = "Gary Paulsen"

# p "My favorite book is #{book_title} by #{book_author}."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# print "Please enter a password:"
# password = gets.chomp.downcase
# if password == "joshua"
#   p "Shall we play a game"
# else
#   p "Access denied!"
# end

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# city1 = "Milwaukee"
# city2 = "Chicago"
# city3 = "Green Bay"

# p city1 + " and " + city3 + " are great cities, but " + city2 + " is not."
